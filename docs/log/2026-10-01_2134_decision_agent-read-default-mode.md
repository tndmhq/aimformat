# Decision (READS-D2): the default read mode stays `full`

**Status: proposed — awaiting founder approval.** Implemented (uncommitted) as part of the agent read and edit surface work on branch `wt/aim-agent-reads`, target release 0.6.0.

## Context

[READS-D1](2026-10-01_2134_decision_agent-read-modes.md) adds cheaper read modes. The default decides what every
existing caller and every agent that does not read the description gets.
`full` is the expensive mode (67k tokens on a 775-chunk document).

## Options considered

1. **Keep `full` as the default.** No result-shape change for any caller.
   Agents on long documents are steered by the server instructions and the
   tool description. Chosen for now.
2. **`auto`:** `full` under a size budget, toc plus a hint above it. The
   result shape would then depend on file size, which breaks programs that
   call the tool and makes runs harder to reproduce.
3. **Default to `text`.** The cheapest default, but it changes the shape for
   every caller, and the text view is lossy, so an agent that edits from
   the default read would be working from the wrong representation.

## Decision

Option 1. `full` stays the default. Revisit once real agent runs show whether
agents follow the instructions to orient with `toc`/`text`/`aim_search`. An
`auto` behaviour, if wanted later, is added as an explicit mode, never as a
change to the default.

## Consequences

- Nothing changes for callers that omit `mode`.
- The savings of the new modes depend on agents choosing them; the server
  instructions and tool description name them first.

## Compatibility and migration

None needed.
