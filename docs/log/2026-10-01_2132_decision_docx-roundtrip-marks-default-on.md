# Decision: ROUNDTRIP-D4 — round-trip marks on by default in DOCX export

**Status:** proposed — awaiting maintainer approval. Nothing is implemented yet. This entry is one of the
DOCX round-trip decision set (gap G3: chunk identity lost on
`.aim` → DOCX → edited in Word → DOCX → `.aim`). Sibling decisions:
[ROUNDTRIP-D1](2026-10-01_2132_decision_docx-roundtrip-identity-carrier.md), [ROUNDTRIP-D2](2026-10-01_2132_decision_docx-roundtrip-marker-placement.md), [ROUNDTRIP-D3](2026-10-01_2132_decision_docx-roundtrip-manifest.md), [ROUNDTRIP-D5](2026-10-01_2132_decision_docx-roundtrip-import-revision-entry-point.md), [ROUNDTRIP-D6](2026-10-01_2132_decision_docx-roundtrip-changes-as-proposals.md), [ROUNDTRIP-D7](2026-10-01_2132_decision_docx-roundtrip-id-alignment.md), [ROUNDTRIP-D8](2026-10-01_2132_decision_docx-roundtrip-conversion-noise.md), [ROUNDTRIP-D9](2026-10-01_2132_decision_docx-roundtrip-three-way-drift.md), [ROUNDTRIP-D10a](2026-10-01_2132_decision_docx-roundtrip-colleague-track-changes.md), [ROUNDTRIP-D10b](2026-10-01_2132_decision_docx-roundtrip-word-resolutions.md), [ROUNDTRIP-D11](2026-10-01_2132_decision_docx-roundtrip-no-diff-resolve.md), [ROUNDTRIP-D12](2026-10-01_2132_decision_docx-roundtrip-informative-convention.md), [ROUNDTRIP-D13](2026-10-01_2132_decision_docx-roundtrip-architecture.md). Baseline under test: aimformat 0.5.2 (`79a006b`).

## Shared context (G3)

Measured on `tests/fixtures/docxs/legal-addendum.docx` (81 chunks) with
**no** edits in between: 0 of 81 chunk ids survive `to_docx` → `from_docx`,
and `diff_documents(base, returned)` reports 81 added + 81 deleted, so an
agent has to re-read the whole document (5,804 `o200k_base` tokens for an
`aim_read`-shaped projection) to learn what a colleague changed. Text
survives 81/81 positionally; markup survives 69/81 (bold dropped on three
`num-1` headings, eight `<mark>` highlight colours dropped, a three-image
figure collapsed to one image). Two defects: identity loss, and conversion
noise that is not a colleague edit.

A scratch prototype (outside the repo) measured: bookmarks survive a
LibreOffice 25.8 re-save 81/81; a null round trip aligns 77 by marker +
4 by content with 0 spurious ops (12 noise units suppressed); a synthetic
10-edit set aligns exactly. **Not yet measured:** any Microsoft Word
behaviour, point bookmarks, the custom-XML manifest, the three-way merge,
`tracked`/`reject-all` exports with a non-empty lane, idempotent re-import,
split/merge linking, the fuzzy budget. A manual Word protocol (open a marked
export, perform a fixed list of edits with and without Track Changes, after
Document Inspector, and through a Google Docs round trip; record marker and
manifest survival; commit the saved files as fixtures) gates the
convention-freezing decisions.

## Context

A marked DOCX can be re-aligned by id; an unmarked one only by content.
Users rarely know at export time whether a file will come back.

## Options considered

- **Opt-in** (`roundtrip_marks=False` default): no change to existing
  output, but most returned files would be unmarked forever.
- **On by default, with an opt-out:** chosen, gated as below.

## Decision

- SDK: `to_docx(doc, path, *, pending="tracked", roundtrip_marks=True)`.
- CLI: `aim export … --no-roundtrip-marks`.
- MCP: `aim_export(…, roundtrip_marks=True)`.
- Turning the default on is **gated on the manual Word protocol passing**;
  until then the parameter ships default-off or not at all. A convention
  shipped on by default cannot be taken back from files already sent out.

## Consequences

- **Default output changes.** Every DOCX the SDK writes gains hidden
  bookmarks ([ROUNDTRIP-D2](2026-10-01_2132_decision_docx-roundtrip-marker-placement.md)) and one custom XML part ([ROUNDTRIP-D3](2026-10-01_2132_decision_docx-roundtrip-manifest.md)); measured +4.3% on the
  81-chunk fixture (42,361 → 44,173 bytes). Rendering is unchanged.
- Export time does not grow beyond writing them (the null round trip is
  computed at import, not export — [ROUNDTRIP-D8](2026-10-01_2132_decision_docx-roundtrip-conversion-noise.md)).
- The tndm editor's DOCX downloads change after its SDK pin bump; editor
  tests that byte-compare exported DOCX need fixtures regenerated.
- Word's Document Inspector lists the part under "Custom XML data".
- Metadata disclosure as in [ROUNDTRIP-D3](2026-10-01_2132_decision_docx-roundtrip-manifest.md); `--no-roundtrip-marks` is documented for
  files sent to external parties.

## Compatibility and migration

Mainstream readers ignore hidden bookmarks and custom XML. Any repo-internal
test that byte-compares DOCX output is updated in the same PR. No `.aim`
change.
